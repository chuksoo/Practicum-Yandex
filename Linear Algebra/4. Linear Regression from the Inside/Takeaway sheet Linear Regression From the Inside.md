## Theory

**Dummy code** is a simple code that doesn't mean anything. 

**An identity matrix** is a square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere.  

**An inverse matrix** for a square matrix A is a matrix A with a superscript -1 whose product with A is equal to the identity matrix. 

I**nvertible matrices** are matrices that have an inverse.  

N**on-invertible** are matrices that don't have an inverse.
